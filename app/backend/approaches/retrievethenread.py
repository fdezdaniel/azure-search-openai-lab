Question: 'Write code in Python that creates chatbot using LangChain and Azure OpenAI'

Sources:
info1.txt: How to create ChatGPT Clone. This chain replicates ChatGPT by combining (1)a specific prompt,and (2) the concept of memory.

info2.pdf: Example of how to load the OpenAI Embedding class with environment variables set to indicate to use Azure endpoints
info3.pdf: This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with Azure OpenAI.
info4.pdf: This notebook goes over how to connect to an Azure hosted OpenAI endpoint

Answer:
This code example creates a ChatGPT Clone, replicates ChatGPT by combining a specific prompt, and memory [info1.txt] It connects to an Azure hosted OpenAI endpoint [info4.pdf][info2.pdf], creating a LangChain chain with an Azure OpenAI agent. [code example]
